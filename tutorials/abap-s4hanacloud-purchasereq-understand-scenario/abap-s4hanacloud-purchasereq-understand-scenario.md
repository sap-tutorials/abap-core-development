# Understand the sample scenario how to mitigate a missing released SAP API
<!-- description --> Learn how the 3-tier extensibility model works and the concept how to mitigate a missing released SAP API via wrapping an unreleased SAP API.

## You will learn
- How the 3-tier extensibility model works for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition and SAP S/4HANA
- The concept how to mitigate missing released SAP APIs using a wrapper
- The sample business scenario that will be used to show how to mitigate a missing released SAP APIs by wrapping a BAPI

### Understand the 3-tier extensibility model for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition and SAP S/4HANA

Familiarize yourself with the tier-3 extensibility model by reading the SAP blog [How to use Embedded Steampunk in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition and in on-premise – The new ABAP extensibility guide](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/25/how-to-use-embedded-steampunk-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition-and-in-on-premise-the-new-abap-extensibility-guide/).

### Understand the concept how to mitigate missing released SAP APIs in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition and SAP S/4HANA

Learn the concept how to mitigate missing released SAP APIs by reading the SAP blog [ABAP Cloud – How to mitigate missing released SAP APIs in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition and SAP S/4HANA – The new ABAP Cloud API enablement guide](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/05/24/abap-cloud-how-to-mitigate-missing-released-sap-apis-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition-and-sap-s-4hana-the-new-abap-cloud-api-enablement-guide/) and the official guidelines [ABAP Cloud API Enablement Guidelines for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition, and SAP S/4HANA](https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/05/b0bd8ae6-747e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html).

### Understand the sample scenario used for the tutorial group

User can launch custom online shop application to order gadget. When gadgets are ordered, a purchase requisition is automatically created in the S/4HANA system.

In this scenario you have a Shopping Cart RAP Business Object for an online shop application in tier 1. You then want to be able to create purchase requisitions for the shopping cart entries. In an ideal case, this could be achieved by making use of a released API. In this tutorial group we show how to deal with the case in which no convenient released API is available to create purchase requisitions: you will find a suitable unreleased SAP API to use as an alternative to a released API, you will wrap it in tier 2 and then release the wrapper for consumption in tier 1. You will then integrate this wrapper in your Shopping Cart RAP BO. As a final product, you will have a RAP BO in tier 1 that will consume the released wrapper to create purchase requisitions for your Shopping Cart RAP BO entries.

>This tutorial group follows the assumption that there is no suitable released API to create purchase requisitions, and we therefore need to find and wrap an unreleased API as a suitable alternative. Please be aware that we follow this assumption simply for illustrative purposes, as SAP does indeed provide a released API to create purchase requisitions (see [Integrate released purchase requisition API into Shopping Cart Business Object](abap-s4hanacloud-purchasereq-integrate-api)).

![Scenario overview](scenario_overview.png)

For productive use, you would develop your RAP BO in the productive package `ZCUSTOM_DEVELOPMENT` in your SAP S/4HANA system as suggested in the Developer Extensibility guidelines [Create Structure Package](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/b5670aaaa2364a29935f40b16499972d/076bbbf3fe584439938b27f49daa6765.html?version=202210.000), and you would develop the wrapper in a dedicated package of software component `HOME`, for instance `ZAPI_DEVELOPMENT`. For the scope of this tutorial group we will follow a simplified approach, and you will use local packages `ZLOCAL` and `$TMP` rather than productive packages.

### Verify technical requirements

The following requirements are needed for this tutorial group:

- If your system is running on feature pack stack 1 (SAP S/4HANA 2022 release), you have imported the [SAP Note 3250849](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3250849), [SAP Note 3294354](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3294354), [SAP Note 3330593](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3330593) and [SAP Note 3280851](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3280851) into your system.
- If your system is running on feature pack stack 0 (SAP S/4HANA 2023 release), you have imported the [SAP Note 3350873](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3350873)
- [You are connected to your SAP S/4HANA system in the ABAP Development Tool (ADT) in Eclipse](abap-s4hanacloud-login)
- You have a user in the system with full development authorizations.
- You have set up developer extensibility as described in the official documentation [Set Up Developer Extensibility](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/b5670aaaa2364a29935f40b16499972d/31367ef6c3e947059e0d7c1cbfcaae93.html?version=202210.000). In particular: the `ZLOCAL` structure package is available and you have set up an ABAP Test Cockpit check variant (we will refer to this as 'ATC Check Variant' throughout the tutorial group).

> We suggest to follow this tutorial group using a [Fully-Activated Appliance](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/12/12/sap-s4hana-fully-activated-appliance-create-your-sap-s4hana-1809-system-in-a-fraction-of-the-usual-setup-time/) in SAP Cloud Appliance Library for an easy start without the need for system setup, as the `ZLOCAL` structure package is automatically available, as well as the needed ATC check variant and the material used for the gadget shopping cart entries.
