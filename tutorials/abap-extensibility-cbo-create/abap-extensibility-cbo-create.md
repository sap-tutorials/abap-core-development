The UI for maintaining fields looks as follows.

![Custom Business Object's Field List View](CBO_Fieldlist_partly.png)

### Add standard data to the structure

1. In the details view for editing the custom business object switch to  **General Information** Section.

2. Check the **System Administrative Data** box to add standardized fields for `Created On`, `Created By`, `Last Changed On` and `Last Changed By`.

    ![Check System Administrative Data](CBO_checkSysAdminData.png)
    >By checking this box the four fields also appear in the field list. The fields are not editable and will be filled and updated automatically, so that you do not need to implement logic for them. Logic implementations for these fields are even ignored.

### Create database persistence

**Publish** the business object `Bonus Plan`.

![Press Publish](CBO_pressPublish.png)

This creates the database persistence of the business object.

### Test yourself
