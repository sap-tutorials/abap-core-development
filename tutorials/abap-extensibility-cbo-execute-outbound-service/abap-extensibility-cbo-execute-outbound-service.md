# Execute an Outbound Service from Custom Business Object Logic
<!-- description --> Call an external service of SAP Business Accelerator Hub from inside the logic implementation of a custom business object.

## Prerequisites  
**Authorizations:** Your user needs
- (a) business role(s) with business catalogs **Extensibility - Custom Business Objects** (ID: `SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_CBO`), **Communication Management** (ID: `SAP_CORE_BC_COM`) and **Extensibility - Custom Communication Scenarios** (ID: `SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_CCS`) in your **SAP S/4HANA Cloud** system
- access to **[SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com)**.
**Example Objects:** Existence of custom business object `Bonus Entitlement` as described in this [tutorial](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/02/20/part-iv-associated-business-objects-bonus-entitlement-with-plan-sales-order/) (Blog), but without any special `bonusplan-releasestatus` logic.
**Knowledge:** (optional) [Tutorial: Tour the SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-abh-getting-started.html)

## You will learn
- How to get needed service data from SAP Business Accelerator Hub Sandbox
- How to configure outbound service connection in SAP S/4HANA Cloud system
- How to call and process an outbound service in custom business object logic

## Intro
The example application of `Bonus Entitlement` will be enhanced by a feedback functionality. The manager's feedback will be translated automatically into English by calling the externally available service **SAP Translation Hub** of SAP.
> Be aware that the example is done with the SAP Business Accelerator Hub Sandbox system only. This shall only give an idea on how it works and cannot be used productively.

>Tutorial feasibility last checked with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Release 2408

    | **`Feedback's language`** | **`FeedbacksLanguage`** | **`Text`** | Length: **`2`** |
    | **`Feedback in english`** | **`FeedbackInEnglish`** | **`Text`** | Length: **`255`** |

6. **Publish** the business object.


### Enhance custom business object logic

Now as the business object has just been published, the logic can be enhanced by the translation functionality. ABAP for key users was enhanced by the classes `CL_BLE_HTTP_CLIENT`, `CL_BLE_HTTP_REQUEST` and `CX_BLE_HTTP_EXCEPTION` to enable you to work with HTTP requests.

1. Switch to **Logic** section.

2. Enter the **After Modification** Event Logic.

    ![Enter After Modification logic](CBO_go2AfterModify.png)

3. Code HTTP client creation
   
    In order to call an external service from there you need to create an HTTP client in your custom business object logic.

    - In the already existing coding go to the end but stay in front of the last ENDIF
  
    - Implement a check if the outbound service is available

        ```abap
        * Check if the outbound service is available
        CHECK cl_ble_http_client=>is_service_available(
            communication_scenario = 'YY1_SAP_TRANSLATION_HUB'
            outbound_service       = 'YY1_OS_SAP_TRANSLATION_HUB_REST'
        ) = abap_true.
        ```

    - Implement creation of HTTP client

        ```abap
        * Create HTTP client to access the outbound service
        DATA(lo_client) = cl_ble_http_client=>create(
            communication_scenario = 'YY1_SAP_TRANSLATION_HUB'
            outbound_service       = 'YY1_OS_SAP_TRANSLATION_HUB_REST'
        ).
        ```

4. Code request body string

    Implement the creation of the Request Body.
    
    As the aim is to translate every other language than english into english, the target language is set to english. The source language and the to be translated feedback are gotten from the corresponding fields of the custom business object.
    
    The request body in JSON format looks this way.

    ```json
    {
        "sourceLanguage": "es",
        "targetLanguages": [
            "en"
        ],
        "units": [
            {
                "value": "Su texto a traducir"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    In the custom business object logic you have to supply this request as string. The `sourceLanguage` and `value` values have to be replaced with variables. The [XCO JSON module](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0f69f8fb28ac4bf48d2b57b9637e81fa/b3b824fb2b244bc0a95667567cdb9103.html?version=2408.500) as part of the key user (KU) edition of the XCO library can be used to create the JSON string for the request body according to the required format.

    ```abap
    * Create request body json string
    DATA(lo_json_builder) = xco_ku_json=>data->builder( ).
    lo_json_builder->begin_object(
        )->add_member( 'sourceLanguage'
            )->add_string( bonusentitlement-feedbackslanguage
        )->add_member( 'targetLanguages'
            )->begin_array(
                )->add_string( 'en'
            )->end_array(
        )->add_member( 'units'
            )->begin_array(
                )->begin_object(
                    )->add_member( 'value'
                        )->add_string( bonusentitlement-feedback
                )->end_object(
            )->end_array(
    )->end_object( ).
    
    DATA(lv_request_body) = lo_json_builder->get_data( )->to_string( ).
    ```
    
5. Code service request creation

    Create the service request and set several properties

    ```abap
    * Creation of the service request
    DATA(request) = cl_ble_http_request=>create( ).
    request->set_method( if_ble_http_request=>co_method-post
    )->set_body( lv_request_body
    )->set_header_parameter( name  = 'APIKey'
                             value = '< YOUR API KEY >'
    )->set_content_type( 'application/json; charset=utf-8' ).
    ```

6. Code request sending and response processing

    1. Implement sending the request by the use of the before created HTTP client and receive the response.

        ```abap
        * Send a request and receive a response.
        DATA(response) = lo_client->send( request ).
        ```
    
    2. Implement getting the response body from the response.

        ```abap
        * Get the body of the response.
        DATA(lv_response_body) = response->get_body( ).
        ```
    
    3. The response body in JSON format will look like this

        ```json
        {
            "units": [
                {
                    "value": "Su texto a traducir",
                    "translations": [
                        {
                            "language": "en",
                            "value": "Your text to translate",
                            "translationProvider": 1,
                            "qualityIndex": 25
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

    4. Implement getting the translation part from the JSON string by the help of the [XCO JSON module](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0f69f8fb28ac4bf48d2b57b9637e81fa/b3b824fb2b244bc0a95667567cdb9103.html?version=2408.500)

        ```abap  
        * Get translation from response
        TYPES:
            BEGIN OF ts_translation,
                language             TYPE c LENGTH 2,
                value                TYPE string,
                translation_provider TYPE i,
                quality_index        TYPE i,
            END OF ts_translation,
            BEGIN OF ts_unit,
                value        TYPE string,
                translations TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ts_translation WITH NON-UNIQUE DEFAULT KEY,
            END OF ts_unit,
            BEGIN OF ts_response,
                units TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ts_unit WITH NON-UNIQUE DEFAULT KEY,
            END OF ts_response.
        DATA ls_response TYPE ts_response.

        xco_ku_json=>data->from_string( lv_response_body )->apply( VALUE #(
            ( xco_ku_json=>transformation->pascal_case_to_underscore )
        ) )->write_to( REF #( ls_response ) ).

        bonusentitlement-feedbackinenglish = ls_response-units[ 1 ]-translations[ 1 ]-value.
        ```

        The response of the service call is translated into a corresponding ABAP structure. With help of the built-in Camel case/Pascal case to underscore transformation the JSON data is adjusted to ABAP requirements.

    5. Implement error handling
        
        Consider a proper error handling by putting a TRY and CATCH block around the service call logic.

        ```abap
        TRY .

        " < CODING PARTS OF THIS STEP FROM BEFORE TO BE PLACED HERE >

    	    CATCH cx_ble_http_exception INTO DATA(lx).
        * The http status code can be checked.
                CASE lx->status_code.
                    WHEN 404.
        * Error handling
                    WHEN OTHERS.
        * Error handling
                ENDCASE.
        ENDTRY.
        ```

7. Publish the After Modification logic.


### Test the application

1. Start typing **Bonus Entitlements** in the Launchpad search and open the App from the results.

    ![Bonus Entitlements application from search results](FLP_searchResult_BonusEntitlements.png)

3. Open a `Bonus Entitlement`.

4. Enter following data

    | Field Label | Field Value |
    | :------------- | :--------------------------- |
    | Feedback | **`Su texto a traducir`** |
    | Feedback's Language | **`es`** |

    > Please note that the language code must be entered in lower case to ensure that the service call is successful.

5. **Save** the Bonus Entitlement. The translation will get filled.
