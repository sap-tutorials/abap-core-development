# Create a SAP Fiori Shopping Cart App and Deploy it
<!-- description --> Create a SAP Fiori app for a business object in Visual Studio Code and deploy it.

## Prerequisites  
- This tutorial can be used in both SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition system and SAP S/4HANA on-premise system with release 2023 FPS01. We suggest using a [Fully-Activated Appliance](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/12/12/sap-s4hana-fully-activated-appliance-create-your-sap-s4hana-1809-system-in-a-fraction-of-the-usual-setup-time/) in SAP Cloud Appliance Library for an easy start without the need for system setup.
- The steps for fully-qualified Domain Name & SSL Certificates can be found [here](https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/06/109b1be0-9e7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html).
- For SAP S/4HANA on-premise, create developer user with full development authorization 
- You have installed the latest [Eclipse with ADT](abap-install-adt).
- You set up [VS Code for Fiori Tools](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/fiori-tools-vscode-setup.html)

## You will learn  
- How to create an ABAP package 
- How to create list report object pages
- How to run SAP Fiori applications
- How to deploy applications
- How to check BSP library in Eclipse


## Intro
In this tutorial, wherever ### appears, use a number (e.g. 000). This tutorial is done with the placeholder 000.

This scenario describes the embedded deployment, which features an SAP Fiori front-end server (and the associated components) deployed along with the backend components in the same system.

### Create an ABAP package

In this step, we'll create an ABAP package with the **`superpackage` `ZLOCAL`**. 

  1.  Select **`ZLOCAL`** > **New** > **ABAP Package**.

      ![package](package.png)

  2.  Create new **ABAP package**:
       - Name: **`Z_SHOPPING_CART_TIER1_###`**
       - Description: Package ### - Tier 1
       - `Superpackage:` **`ZLOCAL`**
       - Package Type: Development
 
      ![package](package2.png)

       Click **Next >**.

  3. Click **Next >**.

      ![package](package3.png)


  4. Click **Finish**.
  
      ![package](package4.png) 

 
  5. Now continue with step 2 of [Create an Shopping Cart Business Object](abap-s4hanacloud-procurement-purchasereq-shop). Move on with [Enhance the Behavior Definition and Behavior Implementation of the Shopping Cart Business Object](abap-s4hanacloud-purchasereq-enhance-shop) and [Integrate released purchase requisition API into Shopping Cart Business Object](abap-s4hanacloud-purchasereq-integrate-api). Afterwards, come back and continue with step 2 of this tutorial.
 

### Create list report object page

This step is for creating a list report object page. Open Visual Studio Code and open your visual studio projects folder
 
  1. Open **Visual Studio Code** and open your **Visual Studio Code projects folder**. Select the **projects** folder. Your created projects will later appear in this folder.

     ![object](vs.png)

    >**Hint:** You can find your folder under: `C:\Users\<userid>\projects`.

  2. Select the menu on the top and click **View > Command Palette**.

      ![object](vs2.png)

  3. Search for **Fiori: Open Application Generator** and select it.

      ![object](vs3.png)
 
  4. Select **Template Type: SAP Fiori**, as template **List Report Page** and click **Next >**.

      ![object](vs4.png)

  5. Configure data source, system and service:
     - Data source: **Connect to a System**
     - System: New System
     - System type: **ABAP On Premise**
     - System URL: `https://mysystem.fqdn.com:44301`
     - SAP client: 100
     - Service username: `<your_username>`
     - Service password: `<your_password>`
       
       Click the login symbol on the right side to log in.

     - System name: `<your_system_ur>`
     - Service: **`ZUI_SHOPCART_O4_### > ZUI_SHOPCART_###(0001) - OData V4`**

     ![object](new2.png)

     Click **Next >**.

    >**Hint:** In case of invalid security certificate errors, follow this [link](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/4b318bede7eb4021a8be385c46c74045.html).

  6. Select your main entity **`ShoppingCart`** and click **Next >**.

      ![object](new3.png)

  7. Configure project attributes:  
     - Name: **`z_shopping_cart_tier1_###`**
     - Title: **Shopping Cart ###**
     - Description: **A Fiori application.**
     - Project folder path: `c:\Users\<userid>\projects`
     - Add deployment configuration: Yes
     - Add FLP configuration: Yes
     - Configure advanced options: No

     Click **Next >**. 

      ![object](new4x.png)

     An FLP configuration does not have to be created in Visual Studio Code, as this will be created in a later step using [tools for setting up the Launchpad content](https://help.sap.com/docs/FLP/6583b46f6c164aad818a3891bc91d8d8/08683e5409b74ced8705b2856c96c63b.html?state=DRAFT).

     The project folder path has a further substructure.

    >**Hint:** Your **module name must** be written in **lowercase letters**.

  8. Configure deployment:
       - Target: ABAP
       - Target system: `<your_abap_system_url>`
       - Enter client: 100
       - SAPUI5 ABAP Repository: `zshopcart_###`
       - Package: `z_shopping_cart_tier1_###`
       - How do you want to enter Transport Request? Manually
       - Transport Request: `<your_transport_request>`

     ![app](new5x.png)

       Click **Next >**.

     **Hint:** If you want to copy your transport request, please do following:  Open Eclipse, search your package **`Z_PURCHASE_REQ_###`** and open it. Open your transport organizer to see your transport request. The transport request of the superior folder needs to be chosen. Copy your transport request for later use. You can find your **transport request** underneath the **Modifiable** folder.
      ![app](transportrequest.png)
 

  9. Configure Fiori Launchpad settings:
       - Semantic Object: `z_shopping_cart_tier1_###`
       - Action: maintain
       - Title: Shopping Cart ###  
    
     ![app](newxx.png)

       Click **Finish**.



### Run SAP Fiori application for data preview

In this step, we'll run the SAP Fiori application, to check 


  1. In the **Application Information** overview, select **Preview Application** to start the preview.

      ![deploy](new6x.png)

  2. Log in with your credentials. Then select the first entry in the search bar.
  
      ![url](new7x.png)

  3. Your browser opens. Click **Go** and check your application. 

      ![url](new8x.png)


### Deploy your application 

This step describes the deployment of the created application.


  1. In the **Application Information** overview, select **Deploy Application** to start the deployment.

      ![deploy](new9x.png)   

  2. When prompted, check deployment configuration and pressÂ y. Open the URL at the end of the deployment log in browser to preview the application.

      ![deploy](new10x.png)

      When the deployment is successful, you will get these two information back as a result: **deployment successful**.

    >**Hint:** If an error message appears, use the [Environment Check](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/75390cf5d81e43aea5db231ef4225268.html).


### Run your application standalone

  1. Open the URL to open the deployed application.
 
      ![deploy](new11x.png) 

  2. Click **Go** and check your application.

      ![deploy](new8x.png) 

### Check BSP library in Eclipse


  1. Open Eclipse and check the **BSP library** in your package **`z_purchase_req_tier1_###`**. You can find your package under **Local Objects (`ZLOCAL`)** > **User123**. If you are not able to see BSP applications and SAP Fiori Launchpad app description items, refresh your package by pressing `F5`.
